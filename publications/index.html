	<h2>Creative Story Generation</h2>
	<p>Below are some posters for work I've done in Creative Neural Natural Language Generation.
		I presented them at the ISI reception for the <a href="https://iui.acm.org/2019/">IUI</a>
		conference. Both are excerpts of research work under review for publication, but posters are
	often more consumable for a broader audience.</p>
	<p>
		<a href="NAACL_work_2019_poster.pdf">Interactive Open Domain Story Generation</a>:
		an investigation into Human-Computer collaboration for story writing.
		<br>
		<a href="ACL_work_2019_poster.pdf">Exasperatingly Hard Creative Story Generation</a>:
		a comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of multiple state-of-the-art systems, including
		a new system we propose.
