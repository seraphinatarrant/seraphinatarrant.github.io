	<p>I'm Seraphina Goldfarb-Tarrant, and I'm a graduate student in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
		imminently finishing my MS at
		the University of Washington. </p>
	<p>I do research in Creative Neural Natural Language Generation (a mouthful, aka <strong>NLG</strong> for short),
		at the <a href="https://www.isi.edu/">Information Sciences Institute </a> in the lab of
		<a href="https://violetpeng.github.io/">Nanyun (Violet) Peng</a>.
		<br>
		I also do
		Human-Computer Interaction, and have an interest in Multilingual NLP and in Fairness and Bias
		in Machine Learning.
	</p>
	<p>I have a varied background: I have lived in many places around the world and worked in a few
	different fields. My homes have been Tokyo, NYC, California, Seattle, Shanghai - and in those places I've worked both for Google and for smaller projects.
		<br><br>
		As well as being extremely passionate about NLP, I am a professional
		sailor and spent a few years sailing the North Sea. I also study
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinzai_school">Rinzai Zen</a>, which is the type
		with the riddles (koans) and samurai associations. </p>
	<p>Feel free to check out my <a href="cv/">CV</a> and my <a href="publications/">research/publications</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also started a <a href="blog/">blog</a>, where I will explain my research (and sometimes some other peopleâ€™s) in a way that I hope is understandable to anyone curious enough to read it.
