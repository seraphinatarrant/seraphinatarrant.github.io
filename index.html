	<p>I'm Seraphina Goldfarb-Tarrant, and I -
		<ul>
		<li> am doing a PhD at the University of Edinburgh in ILCC, advised by
			<a href="https://alopez.github.io">Adam Lopez</a>, in Multilingual NLP and its interactions
			with dataset artifacts, Fairness, and Bias. </li>
		<li> have an MS in NLP from University of Washington </li>
		<li> did research in Creative Neural Natural Language Generation (a mouthful, aka <strong>NLG</strong> for short),
		at the <a href="https://www.isi.edu/">Information Sciences Institute </a> in the lab of
			<a href="https://violetpeng.github.io/">Nanyun (Violet) Peng</a>.</li>
		<li> think this bio reminds me a bit of <a href="https://external-preview.redd.it/K7KxEp9j4GIGeo2shdf0N02eXBwAfGGiLwY5HNjH-ZA.jpg?auto=webp&s=b13cbdccdeee37518538a628c5817466a968d774">this</a>.</li>
		</ul>

	</p>
	<p>I have a varied background: I have a BA in Ancient Greek, and I have lived in many places around the world and worked in a few
	different fields. My homes have been Tokyo, NYC, California, Seattle, Shanghai -  in those places I've worked both for Google and on smaller projects.
		<br><br>
		As well as being extremely passionate about NLP, I am a professional
		sailor and spent a few years sailing the North Sea. I also study
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinzai_school">Rinzai Zen</a>, which is the type
		with the riddles (koans) and samurai associations. </p>
	<p>Feel free to check out my <a href="cv/">CV</a> and my <a href="publications/">research/publications</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also started a <a href="blog/">blog</a>, where I will explain my research (and sometimes some other peopleâ€™s) in a way that I hope is understandable to anyone curious enough to read it.
