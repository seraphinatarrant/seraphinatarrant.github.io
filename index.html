	<p>I'm Seraphina Goldfarb-Tarrant, and I -
		<ul>
		<li> am the Head of Safety at <a href="https://cohere.com/">Cohere</a>, where I try my best to evaluate and mitigate any societal harms cause by language models, and to make LMs more trustworthy, </li>
		<li> have a PhD in Informatics (CS) from the University of Edinburgh in ILCC, advised by
			<a href="https://alopez.github.io">Adam Lopez</a>. I focused on Fairness in NLP, my thesis is: <a href="https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/41857">Fairness in Transfer Learning for NLP</a> </li>
		<li> have an MSc in NLP from University of Washington </li>
		<li> did research in Creative Neural Natural Language Generation (a mouthful, aka <strong>NLG</strong> for short),
		at the <a href="https://www.isi.edu/">Information Sciences Institute </a> in the lab of
			<a href="https://violetpeng.github.io/">Nanyun (Violet) Peng</a>.</li>
		<li> think this bio reminds me a bit of <a href="https://external-preview.redd.it/K7KxEp9j4GIGeo2shdf0N02eXBwAfGGiLwY5HNjH-ZA.jpg?auto=webp&s=b13cbdccdeee37518538a628c5817466a968d774">this</a>.</li>
		</ul>

	<p>
		I am currently looking for interns (I usually am, but also currently!). If you are interested, please email me a few paragraphs up to 2 pages on a research idea or proposal, and let's chat.
	</p>

	<p>I have a varied background: I live in the UK and work in AI now, but I have a BA in Ancient Greek, and I have lived in many places around the world and worked in a few
	different fields. My homes have been Tokyo, NYC, San Francisco, Seattle, Shanghai -  in those places I've worked both for Google and on smaller projects.
		<br><br>
		As well as being extremely passionate about NLP, I am a professional
		sailor and spent a few years sailing the North Sea. I also study
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinzai_school">Rinzai Zen</a>, which is the type
		with the riddles (koans) and samurai associations. </p>
	<p>Feel free to check out my <a href="cv/">CV</a> and my <a href="publications/">research/publications</a>. Because I am not good at updating this site, my list of publications may be more up to date on
		<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ywWpui8AAAAJ&hl=en">my Google Scholar</a>. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I started a <a href="blog/">blog</a> in my MSc, to explain my research (and sometimes some other peopleâ€™s) in a way that I hope is understandable to anyone curious enough to read it.
		But as is the case with all blogs, I wrote one article ever and then abandoned the enterprise, though I do write some content at Cohere and may link that here eventually. 
		For instance, I wrote the 7 things to Know about Safety in NLP, which marketing rebranded as <a href="https://cohere.com/blog/the-enterprise-guide-to-ai-safety">the Enterprise Guide to AI Safety</a>, with no real change in content.
	</p>
	<p> I am quite passionate about explaining things well, and frequently give talks and lectures.
		I mentor students (and sometimes co-supervise) and I accept interns at Cohere. If any of these things interest you, please feel free to get in touch!
	</p>

		If you need a blurb for an event I am speaking at, you may nick this one below: <br>
		<i>Dr. Seraphina Goldfarb-Tarrant is the Head of Safety at Cohere, where she works on both
		the practice and the theory of evaluating and mitigating harms from LLMs. She has a PhD
		in NLP from the University of Edinburgh, with a focus on Fairness, and an MSc from UW, with a focus on generation.
		Her research interests include the intersection of fairness with robustness and generalisation, cross-lingual transfer, and causal analysis.
		Before her PhD, she worked as a Research Engineer at the Information Sciences Institute, and for many years at Google in Tokyo, NYC, and Shanghai.
		She also spent two years as a sailor in the North Sea.</i>
