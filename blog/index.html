title: Here's where I talk to humans about AI
---
    <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
    <p>In research, I talk to AI about humans, here, I will practice doing the reverse.</p>
    <p>
		I very strongly believe that, unless I can explain a concept to someone outside my field, I don’t understand it.
		Industry jargon is useful because it is information dense; a four-page paper in NLP would have to be
		much longer without our specific terminology. But jargon also isolates a field and makes it harder to share ideas across disciplines.
		It can make us researchers not examine our work enough, since we glaze over these terms that we know and
		can be lulled into a false sense of security that work is good because it sounds official.
		So in my blog the idea is to make my work understandable for those with no specific NLP background.
